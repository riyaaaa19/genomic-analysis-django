# Genomic Data Analysis Tool

A Django-based web application for genomic data analysis, featuring clustering, classification, and interactive visualization. Designed to streamline genomic data preprocessing, analysis, and reporting for researchers and bioinformaticians.

---

## Features

* **Data Preprocessing**

  * SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance datasets
  * Feature selection to identify important genomic markers
  * Cross-validation for model robustness

* **Clustering**

  * K-means clustering to discover groups or patterns in genomic data

* **Classification Models**

  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
  * Logistic Regression
    Users can toggle between models to compare results

* **Visualizations**

  * Interactive plots using Plotly for exploratory data analysis
  * Feature importance visualization to interpret model decisions

* **Reporting**

  * Generate comprehensive analysis reports based on selected data and models

---

## Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Django (Python)
* **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn (for SMOTE)
* **Visualization:** Plotly
* **Database:** SQLite (default, easily switchable to PostgreSQL)
* **Frontend:** Django templates with HTML/CSS/JavaScript
